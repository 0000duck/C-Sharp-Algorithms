# C-Sharp-Algorithms
Implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms in C#

I am writing this organized collection of classes as part of my preparation for technical interviews. This is for educational purposes only. This solution-library doesn't aim to replace any well-written data structure and algorithms library out there.

### Data Structures:
* SLList.cs (Singly-Linked List).
* DLList.cs (Doubly-Linked List).
* Stack.cs (Stack - LIFO).
